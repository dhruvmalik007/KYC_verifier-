This is the suggested template for new EIPs.

Note that an EIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your EIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `eip-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

The title should be 44 characters or less. It should not repeat the EIP number in title, irrespective of the category. 

## Abstract

- This EIP Provides a defined interface for KYC verification with abstract on-chain conditions.

- This EIP defined the necessary interface functions to verify the identity of the wallet holder, based on the conditions described by the user on-chain.

## Motivation

On-chain verification is becoming indispensable across DeFi as well as other web3 protocols (DAO, governance) as it's needed by the government for due diligence of actors, but also by different Defi protocols to whitelist the users which fulfill certain regulations concerning identity/deposit schemes, etc. This created the necessity of building on-chain verification of the addresses for token transfers (like stablecoin providers checking for the blacklisted entities for the destination address, limited utility tokens for a DAO community, etc). 


current standards in the space, like [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) are insufficient to handle the complex use cases where: 

    -  The validation logic needs to be more complex than the verification of the user identity wrt the blacklisted address that is Defined off-chain and is very gas inefficient. 
    
    - also privacy-enhanced/anonymous verification is an important need by crypto users to insure censorship/trustless networks. ZK-based verification schemes are currently the only way to validate the assertion of the identity by the user while keeping certain aspects of the provider's identity completely private.

thus to address the two above major challenges: there needs to be the creation of an identity verifier standard that: 
	- will be assigning the identification badges onchain by the KYC contracts to users which are immutable and non-transferrable by the owner itself.
	- being able to prove the ownership of the assigned contract to the users 

## Specification: 

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**DeFinition**

- SBT: Soul Bound Tokens, these are non-fungible and non-transferrable tokens that are used for defining the identity of the users. they are Defined by standard [eip-5192](./eip-5192.md).

- SBT Certificates: SBT that represent the  ownerships of ID signatures corresponding to the requirements defined in `function standardRequirement()`.
	
**Functions**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
    // getter function 
    /// @notice getter function to validate if the address `verifying` is the holder of the SBT Defined by the tokenId `SBTID`
    /// @dev it MUST be Defining the logic corresponding to all the current possible requirements DeFinition.

    /// @param verifying is the  EOA address that wants to validate the SBT issued to it by the KYC. 
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT of which the user is the claimer.
    /// @return true if the assertion is valid, else false
    /**
    example ifVerified(0xfoo, 1) => true will mean that 0xfoo is the holder of the SBT identity token DeFined by tokenId of the given collection. 
    */

        "description": "If this person is more than 18 years old",
        },
       "logic": ">=",
    "value":"18"  
}

    */
    function standardRequirement(uint256 SBTID) external view returns (Requirement[] memory);

    /// @dev it should only be called by the admin address.
    /// @param SBTID is the Id of the SBT-based identity certificate for which the admin wants to DeFine the Requirements.
    /// @param `requirements` is the struct array of all the descriptions of condition metadata that the administrator defines. check the metadata section for more information.
    function changeStandardRequirement(uint256 SBTID, Requirement[] memory requirements) external returns (bool);
    
    /// @notice function which uses the ZKProof protocol to validate the identity based on the given verification protocol. (STARKS, SNARKS ...)

    function revoke(address certifying, uint256 SBTID) external returns (bool);
```

**Events**

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;   
/** 
    * standardChanged
    * @notice standardChanged MUST be triggered when requirements are changed. 
    * @dev standardChanged MUST also be triggered for the creation of a new SBTID.
    */
    event standardChanged(uint256 SBTID, Requirement[]);   
    
    /** 
    * certified
    * @notice certified MUST be triggered when SBT certificate is given to the certifiying address. 
    */
    event certified(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);
    
    /** 
    * revoked
    * @notice revoked MUST be triggered when SBT certificate is revoked. 
    */
    event revoked(address certifying, uint256 SBTID);
```

## Rationale

**Metadata structure**: 

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev metadata and Values structure of the Metadata, cited from [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 
     */     
    struct Metadata {
        string title;
        string _type;
        string description;
    }
    
    /**
     * @dev Values here can be read and wrote by smartcontract and front-end, cited from [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 
     */   
    struct Values { 
        string stringValue;
        uint uintValue;
        address addressValue;
        bool boolValue;
    }
```

**Requirement structure**:

```solidity

    /**
     * @dev structure that DeFines the parameters for specific requiremet of the SBT certificate
     * @notice this structure is used for the verification process, it chontains the metadata, logic and expectation
     * @logic given here MUST be one of ("⊄", "⊂", "<", "<=", "==", "!=", ">=",">")
     ex: standardRequirement => {
    { "title":"adult",
        "type": "uint",
        "description": "If this person is more than 18 years old",
        },
       "logic": ">=",
    "value":"18"  
	}
	Defines the condition encoded for the identity index 1, Defining the identity condition that holder must be more than 18 		years old.
    */
	
    struct Requirement {
        Metadata metadata;
        string logic;
        Values expectation;
    }

```

## Backwards Compatibility

Any existing fungible/non fungible asset contract standards (eip-20, 721, 1155, 3475 etc.) can use this interface to access-control the execution of certain functions only by the address holding the right SBT certificates.

**Note that the this standard interface is also compatible with [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) and [EIP-3475](./eip-3475.md) 

However, an update is needed to amend the KYC modifier in case the conditions of validating the KYC of the address is changed.

## Test Cases

Test-case for the minimal reference implementation is [here](./test.sol). Use the Truffle box to compile and test the contracts.

## Reference Implementation

The [interface](./interfaces/IERC6595.sol) contains two separated implementations:

- [verification_modifier](../verification_modifier.sol)
  - modifier that needs to be implemented into the functions which need KYC certification for deployment.

- [SBT_certification](../SBT_certification.sol).
   - functions required in the SBT certificate contract to assign to another address.

## Security Considerations

1. Writing functions interfaces (i.e `changeStandardRequirement()`, `certify()` and `revoke()`)  SHOULD be executed by admin roles in the SBT certificate contract as the getter functions (verify()) depends on the availablity of the necessary metadata to be immutable by any other non-admin entity.

2. The modifiers SHOULD not be deployed for the verifier contract that is upgradable (either via proxy patterns defined by [EIP-1167](./eip-1167.md), [EIP-1967](./eip-1967.md)). if the requirement is deemed important, there needs to be appropriate roles (usually by admin) in order to insure that modifier logic doesnt get corrupted or creates the unintended backdoor.
